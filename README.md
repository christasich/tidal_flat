# tidal_platform

A zero-dimensional morphodynamic model of elevation change on a tidal platform.

## About this project

This project uses a zero-dimensional mass balance approach to model the elevation of a tidal platform over time. This work is based on previous studies (Krone, 1987; Allen, 1990; French, 1993; Temmerman et al., 2003, 2004) on the longterm evolution of marsh surfaces. We describe the fundamentals of the model briefly.

The depth of inundation of a tidal platform is defined as

```math
h(t) = \zeta(t) - \eta(t)
```

where $`\zeta(t)`$ is the water-surface elevation and $\eta(t)`$ is the sediment-surface elevation. The rate of elevation change of the platform is then described as

```math
\frac{d\eta(t)}{dt} = \frac{dS_m(t)}{dt} + \frac{dS_o(t)}{dt} + \frac{dP(t)}{dt} + \frac{dM(t)}{dt}
```
